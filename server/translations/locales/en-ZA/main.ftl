            <li>Do <strong>not</strong> prefix a verb with a dash. Prefer go - hamba to go - -hamba.

                na-, for instance in the entry of <a href="https://isixhosa.click/word/89">brush against - thintana na-</a></li>
            <li>Try to come up with a close { source-language } translation for the { target-language } word. If there
                are multiple suitable options which are all in common usage, you might consider making multiple
                <a href="#entry-dfn">entries</a> and <a href="#linked-word-dfn">linking them</a> with the
                <a href="#related-meaning-dfn">related meaning</a> link type.</li>
            <li>For inchoative verbs representing a subject becoming some state,
                put the word become in the { source-language }. For instance,
                <a href="https://isixhosa.click/word/241">become injured - enzakala</a>.</li>

    .examples = Example sentences
    .examples-text =
        <p>Example sentences are another core feature of the site. They help to show the use of the word in a real
        sentence, and can clarify meaning of the word. Try and abide by the following rules when writing examples:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Submit full sentences rather than just phrases. E.g: "Intlanzi idada echibini." is a better
            example for <a href="https://isixhosa.click/word/406">intlanzi</a> than "Intlanzi enkulu".</li>
            <li>Use punctuation at the end of an examples, as well as proper spelling and grammar.</li>
            <li>Try and add at least one example per word.</li>
            <li>Examples should be used to fully demonstrate the meanings and usages of a word. E.g:
                "Ihashe libaleka ebaleni." is a better example for <a href="https://isixhosa.click/word/38">ibala</a> than
                "Ibala likhulu." as the first example shows it is a field of grass rather than a field of study.</li>
            <li>Therefore, avoid examples which are simplistic like "I do [verb]." or "I like [noun]."</li>
            <li>If a word has a common construction it's often used with, add it in an example!</li>
        </ul>
