                <strong>Tim Low,</strong></a>
                for graciously allowing us to reproduce his isiXhosa statistics glossary on the site. Almost all
                entries relating to statistics are from there. We are currently working on a better way to attribute
                these words individually, but for now they should say "stats glossary" in the notes field.</li>
            <li><strong>Dr Tessa Dowling,</strong> for her guidance and many corrections.</li>
            <li><strong>Alexandra Bryant,</strong> for allowing us to use the glossary at the back of her
                excellent book "Xhosa for Second-Language Learners".</li>
            <li><strong>Cuan Dugmore,</strong> for giving us permission to use his word lists containing
                thousands of words that he has collected over the years.</li>
