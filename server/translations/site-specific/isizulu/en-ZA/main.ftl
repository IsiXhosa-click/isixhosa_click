            <li>We would like to thank <strong>Professor Langa Khumalo</strong>
                (clan praises - uMzilikazi KaMashobana! Owawela iZambezi ngezikhali!) for cultivating the corpus
                lexicography framework of which this online isiZulu LSP dictionary is based on. These types of frameworks
                assist in the development of under resourced languages.</li>
            <li>We also like to thank <strong>Professor Maria Keet</strong> for also championing the theories that
                assist to develop African languages.</li>
            <li>We would also like to thank M.B. Kumalo who started to write down the isiZulu & English terms for
                linguistics and literature. Some words that appear in this dictionary are extracted verbatim from
                Kumalo's 1996 publication.</li>
